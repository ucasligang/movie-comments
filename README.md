## 1.Run data.py to pre-operate data.(If you have download my word2id.txt and word2vec.txtï¼Œyou needn't to run it.)
## 2.Update some parameters(learning_rate,batch_size,epochs etc.)in Config.py to apply in your project.
## 3.I provide this model.pth in models(test accuracy is 86.18%,parameters setting:bach_size=128, epochs=10, learning_rate=0.001).Run main.py file to train your model and predict your test data.(Maybe you need do a little modification)
## Then Good Luck!
